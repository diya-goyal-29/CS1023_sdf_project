# How To Play

The player clicks on the "Roll" button to roll the die. If he/she falls on a property, he/she has the option to either buy the property or leave it. If the money in the account of the player is less than the property, then he/she cannot buy the property. If the player falls on another players property, he/she has to pay the rent amount as mentioned in the property card. The player can also build or sell houses once he owns a colony. The more number of houses, more would be the rent. If he/she falls on "Chance" or "Community Chest", he/she can either get a benifit or lose an amount of money. When a player lands on "Go To Jail" or gets a "Go To Jail card", he/she moves forth to the jail. After completeing a round of the board, when the player passes through "GO", he/she gets a salary of $200. <br />
